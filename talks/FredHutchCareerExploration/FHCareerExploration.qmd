## Who am I?

- UChicago alumnus (BS, Mathematics 2019)
- Current PhD student in Applied Math at Fred Hutch and the University of Washington in the Bedford lab.
- Now, I study transmission and evolution of pathogens like influenza and SARS-CoV-2.

## Epidemics are often observed with counts

## We use $R_{t}$ to infer the direction of epidemics

## Pathogens have an evolutionary history

## Mutation can lead to transmission differences

## Variant differences may not show in cases

## Variant frequencies allow us to monitor change

## Turning frequencies into growth advantages

## Transmission models with various strains

## Developing tools for analyzing epidemics

- How did we go from a one-off model to a tool that we can continually use?
- My research is focused on building tools and toolkits for analyzing evolution of pathogens.
- This includes both software (like that used to make today's figures) and mathematical machinery that teaches how and why growth advantages may appear between pathogen variants.

## Takeaways
- Understanding epidemics is complicated by feedback loop between evolution and transmission
- Mathematics and statistics are tools for analyzing data that can provide new insight.
- Once we have an idea in mind, we can build **re-usable** and **customizable** tools for analyzing new data to make new analyses easier.
- This allows us to make many forecasts as we receive new data and opens the door for evolutionary forecasting
