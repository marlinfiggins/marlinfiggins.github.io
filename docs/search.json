    "text": "The Exponential Map\nWhat if every person had on average 1.2 kids every generation? Starting with \\(x_0\\) people, the new population would be \\(1.2 x_0\\) the next generation. After two generations, it’d be \\((1.2)^2 x_0\\) and it’d continue like this for the following generations. We have some growth every generation and it multiplies our current population over and over again. If we want to be more general about this, we can say that the population has a growth parameter \\(\\lambda\\). Then we’d write our population growth each generation as a function\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nf(x) = \\lambda x.\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nIn general, this function is called the exponential map and tells us how big the next generation’s population will be given the population grows by a factor of \\(\\lambda\\). If we keep applying it over and over, we can get the population size several generations in the future. Mathematically, we’d write this as a dynamical system. If we have a starting value or /initial condition \\(x_0\\). Therefore, the population after 1 generation would be \\(f^1(x_0) = \\lambda x_0\\), after two it would be \\(f^2(x_0) = \\lambda^2x_0\\). For simplicity’s sake, we’d say that after \\(n\\) generations the population is\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nf^n(x_0)=\\lambda^nx_0.\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nWe can describe the dynamics of the exponential map by looking at all the population values for each generation\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nx_0, f^1(x_0), f^2(x_0), f^3(x_0), \\dotsc\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nFrom this, we can begin to see that the dynamics will depend on the value of \\(\\lambda\\) we pick. When dealing with the exponential map, we can have two kinds of outcomes. The population will either die out (\\(0<\\lambda < 1\\)) eventually or it will skyrocket and go to infinity (\\(\\lambda >1\\)). If \\(\\lambda < 1\\), then \\(\\lambda \\cdot \\lambda < \\lambda \\cdot 1\\), so the population shrinks and the population will die out over time. On the other hand, if \\(\\lambda > 1\\), then \\(\\lambda \\cdot \\lambda > \\lambda \\cdot 1\\) so the population grows and continues to grow every generation.\nIn the case we were discussing before, \\(\\lambda\\) would be 1.2 kids per person. Each generation, the population would steadily increase and after 20 generations, we’d have over 30,00 people. After 100, we’d have nearly 80 billion!\n\n\n\nGeneration:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n\n\nPopulation:\n1000\n1200\n1440\n1720\n2070\n2490\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the exponential map.\n\n\nThis isn’t very realistic because it assumes the population can get infinitely large. When it comes to human population, this probably isn’t realistic. Population growth has to begin to slow down at some point. In this case, there must be some limiting factor to our population growth.\nInstead of doing this by hand each time, we could also use a compute program to simulate these dynamics. We can use the following code to simulate these dynamics. Here’s an example program I wrote below.\ndef exponential(x_0 = 100, lambd = 1, max_n = 10):\n   x = []\n   x = np.append(x, x_0)\n\n   for n in range(max_n - 1):\n       x = np.append(x, lambd*x[n])\n\n   return x"

    "section": "Logistic Map",
    "text": "Logistic Map\nWhat happens to our model if we assume that resources are somehow limited? As more people appear, it’ll become harder for everyone to meet their individual needs to survive . In order to model this, we need the population change to depend not only on a growth rate, but also how close we are to some theoretical maximum population size. If we say \\(x\\) is the current fraction of this maximum population size, we might change our growth rate from \\(\\lambda\\) to \\(\\lambda (1-x)\\) to allow for the growth rate to decrease as the population increases. Therefore, our model would become\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nf(x) = \\lambda(1-x) x.\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nThis is called the logistic map. Strictly speaking, it is a family of maps depending on different values of \\(\\lambda\\). In order to see what happens to the population each generation, we want to analyze the dynamics like in the last example. In the last example, we were able to write a formula for the dynamics and saw the population would either blow up to infinity or die out eventually. This time around we can’t easily write an explicit equation for the dynamics. One usual tool in cases like these where we can’t easily write down a solution is simulation. We can rely on code to help us visualize the population dynamics over time. Here’s the program I use to the simulate the logistic map in the figures below.\n## Logistic Map\ndef logistic_map(x_0 = 0.4, lambd = 1.2, max_n = 500):\n    x = []\n    x = np.append(x, x_0)\n\n    for n in range(max_n - 1):\n        x_new = lambd*x[n]*(1-x[n])\n        x = np.append(x, x_new)\n    return(x)\nDespite having the tools to simulate this, let’s try to understand this at an intuitive level first since all good code needs a sanity check. We made this model to account for limits on a population and picked a decreasing growth rate, so you might expect that the dynamics will reflect this and keep the population in check. Even though this works on an intuitive level, we should still try and observe it mathematically. Following this intuition, the first thing we should check is whether our population will stabilize as we expect. Much like in the case of the exponential map, this all depends on the value of the growth parameter \\(\\lambda\\).\nIt’s actually not that hard to prove that there is some point of stability where the population will stay the same from year to year. In mathematical terms, this is called a fixed point. From our point of view, we say the population \\(x_\\star\\) is fixed if \\(f(x_\\star) = x_\\star\\).\nProposition: Every continuous function \\(f\\) takes points from \\([0,1]\\) to \\([0,1]\\) has a fixed point.\nProof. Let’s define a new function \\(D(x) = f(x) - x\\). Since \\(f(0)\\) must be in \\([0,1]\\), it must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, we know \\[D(0) = f(0) - 0 \\geq 0.\\] Similarly, \\(f(1)\\) is in \\([0,1]\\), so we know that \\(D(1)<0\\). Since \\(f\\) is continuous, the intermediate value theorem guarantees us that there is a fixed point \\(x_\\star\\).\nIn order for this to hold for the logistic map, we need to make sure that \\(f(x)\\) stays between 0 and 1 which means that \\(\\lambda\\) must be between 0 and 4. Under these assumptions, we can solve for our fixed point(s) directly. One obvious fixed point is \\(x_\\star = 0\\), but let’s see if there are any others. If \\(x_\\star\\) is a non-zero fixed point of \\(f(x)\\), then we need \\(\\lambda(1-x)x = x\\). Dividing by \\(x\\), we get \\(\\lambda(1-x) = 1\\). Multiplying this out, we get \\(\\lambda - 1 = \\lambda x\\) which gives shows that our equilibrium value must be\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nx_\\star = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}.\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nNotice that in order for this fixed point to be greater than 0, we need \\(\\lambda\\) to be greater than 1. This makes sense since otherwise we can expect the population to die out like in the exponential case.\nWe know it’s possible for our population to stabilize, but when will it? We can use the derivative of this function to help us discern whether this point is attracting i.e. whether initial conditions near it will approach this fixed point.\nProposition: If \\(x_\\star\\) is a fixed point and \\(\\abs{ f'(x_\\star)} < 1\\), then it is an attractive fixed point.\nProof. In calculus, we learn that the derivative is given by\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nf'(x_\\star) = \\lim\\limits_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x) -f(x_\\star)}{x-x_\\star}.\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nThis tells us that in some neighborhood of \\(x_\\star\\), \\(f\\) is a contraction. In technical terms, there exists some \\(\\delta > 0\\) such that for \\((x_\\star - \\delta, x_\\star + \\delta)\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\abs{f(x) - f(x_\\star)} < \\abs{ x-x_{\\star}}.\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nThis means that if we pick a initial condition \\(x_0\\) that is close enough to \\(x_\\star\\), then \\(x_0\\) will get closer to \\(x_star\\) after each iteration or generation in our case.\nThis makes our problem much easier. If we want to find which \\(\\lambda\\) values have attracting fixed points, then we just check to see when \\(\\abs{ f'(x_\\star)} < 1\\). Taking the derivative of \\(f\\), we get \\(f'(x) = \\lambda(1-2x)\\). Plugging in our \\(x_\\star\\) value, we see that\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nf'\\left(1- \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\lambda\\left( 1 - 2\\left(1- \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right) = \\lambda\\left(\\frac{2}{\\lambda} - 1\\right) = 2 - \\lambda.\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nThis tells us that the fixed point is attractive for \\(\\lambda\\) between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 3. Now that we’ve confirmed the existence of a fixed point and know a bit about the dynamics of this system, let’s do some simulations to see what happens to our populations over several generations.\n\n\n\n\nPopulation dynamics for different growth parameters\n\n\nAs expected from the math we did above, \\(\\lambda\\) values in \\((1,2)\\) and \\((2,3)\\) approach the fixed point \\(1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\). Relating this back to our original example, this tells us that having limited resources will cause our population to peak and stabilize. We can see this in the plot above, where \\(\\lambda_2 = 1.2\\). Looking into the rest of the cases, we can also notice that for \\(\\lambda < 1\\), the population dies out which makes sense biologically. A population that can’t successfully replenish itself is going to go extinct. What is interesting here are the values of \\(\\lambda\\) that are greater than 3. The population appears to be oscillating periodically for \\(\\lambda_4 = 3.2\\), \\(\\lambda_5 = 3.48\\), and possibly for \\(\\lambda = 3.56\\) which corresponds to the population constantly overshooting its threshold and falling back down. When we get to even higher \\(\\lambda\\) values, these population dynamics seems to fluctuate like crazy, significantly departing from the cases we looked at before."

A bifurcation diagram helps give us an idea about where our system will eventually end up. We take several trajectories for different \\(\\lambda\\) values and plot these \\(\\lambda\\) values against where the corresponding population ends up going in the long term.

This tells us about the end behavior of the dynamics for that growth parameter value. For example, notice that \\(\\lambda_4\\) intersects the curve twice and the population dynamics seem to oscillate with a period of 2. Similarly, \\(\\lambda_5\\) intersects 4 times and we see it has period 4. We can use this idea to confirm our earlier suspicion that the dynamics for \\(\\lambda_6 = 3.56\\) are periodic. Looking at the bifurcation diagram, the line for \\(\\lambda_6\\) appears to intersect 8 times meaning the population dynamics should have period 8. This leaves us to analyze the higher values of \\(\\lambda\\). As you can see, the plot gets messy as \\(\\lambda\\) gets higher. Based on what we saw with the previous cases, there are now many, many points that your population dynamics are going to bounce between and everything becomes extremely irregular. This is chaos."

    "section": "Sensitivity to Initial Conditions",
    "text": "Sensitivity to Initial Conditions\nUp until now, our choice in initial conditions didn’t have much of an effect on where our system ended up. We can see this is the case when we’re working with \\(\\lambda\\) values less than 3. Once we begin to move our \\(\\lambda\\) values above 3, it becomes increasingly important to be precise with our choice of initial conditions \\(x_0\\). As you can see below, different but very close initial conditions \\(x_0\\) can lead to very different dynamics. This property is called sensitivity to initial conditions and is one of the hallmarks of chaos.\n\n\n\n\nVarious initial conditions for \\(\\lambda =3.95\\).\n\n\nHere, we see that the populations do diverge significantly even if they start close to one another, but this doesn’t give an idea of how quickly this occurs. Let’s take two initial conditions \\(x_0\\) and \\(x_0'\\) see how their populations change across several generations. For simplicity, let’s say that \\(x_{0} = x_{0}' + \\Delta x\\). At each generation, we’ll check to see how different the population levels are and plot this difference. Here’s the program I used to do this.\nmax_n = 40\nx_0 = 0.7\npower = -10\nDelta_x = 10**(power)\nIC = [x_0, x_0 + Delta_x]\ntime =  np.linspace(1, max_n, max_n)\n\n\nout1 = logistic_map(lambd = 3.95, max_n = max_n, x_0 = IC[0])\nout2 = logistic_map(lambd = 3.95, max_n = max_n, x_0 = IC[1])\ndist = abs(out1 - out2)\n\n\n\n\nPopulation differences for similar initial conditions.\n\n\nNotice that the difference between the populations appears to grow exponentially in time for a bit. Let’s try to get a measure of how exponential this. If we try to write the distance as \\(\\text{Dist}(t) \\approx Ce^{\\chi t}\\) for some constants \\(C\\) and \\(\\chi\\). Taking the logarithm of this expression, we can see \\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\log(\\text{Dist}) \\approx \\chi t + \\log(C).\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nWith it written this way, we see this is equivalent to saying \\(\\log(\\text{Dist})\\) is approximately linear in time, so we can do a linear regression to estimate the exponential rate \\(\\chi\\).\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [12, 9]\nchi_estimate, logC, r_value, p_value, std_err = stats.linregress(time,np.log(dist))\n\nlin_reg=chi_estimate*time+logC\n\n\n\n\nLog population differences with linear regression.\n\n\nThis leaves us with \\(\\chi \\approx 0.566\\). This number \\(\\chi\\) is called a Lyapunov exponent. In more general contexts, it is used to describe how quickly extremely close trajectories diverge from one another.\nAs of now, we’ve been able to analyze the behavior of the logistic map, which can be used to describe how populations grow in conditions with limited resources. We saw that the growth parameter \\(\\lambda\\) of a population determines how it will grow over time and proved that for some \\(\\lambda\\) values the population will stabilize at a fixed value. We also showed that some growth parameters cause the population to overshoot and undershoot consistently leading to oscillation and that for even higher values we end up with chaos. We were able to visualize how this occurs. We explored what it meant to be chaotic by describing sensitivity to initial condition and getting a measure of how sensitive a system is. This was an exercise in using math to take a stab a question we might have about the real world. First, we made a crude model of how we think populations should change every generation, then we went down the rabbit hole of analyzing it. On the way, we got to see some very pretty math and make some pretty cool plots.\nThat being said, this is not the end-all-be-all of chaos. Chaos is everywhere: in population dynamics with the logistic map, in physics with things like the double pendulum, weather as in the Lorenz equations, and often in infectious disease models. They’re so many chaotic systems out in the world, and I’m itching to write some posts about others that I have or will come across. This also won’t be the last we see of the logistic map. I’m hoping to write a post about the Mandelbrot set, where it comes from, a bit on its connection to the logistic map. For now, this has been an introduction to chaos.\nFrom what we’ve seen in this introduction, chaos is not simply something changing without any rhyme or reason. It must be related to an underlying rule or process describing how things change throughout time or space for a system. Chaos is the idea that uncertainty can grow and grow exponentially quickly. Chaos is realizing that knowing where you are now doesn’t always tell you exactly where you have been in the past. It reminds us that starting from similar conditions or backgrounds doesn’t dictate that you’ll end up in the same place as one another. It tells us that all of our possible paths may at first diverge yet still possibly intersect, intertwine, and become parallel in the future. As you continue along in a chaotic system, it feels as though the future is completely unknown with no clarity to be had. This is when we’re meant to realize that the path ahead is still determined by some underlying rule, even if we don’t understand it yet.\nUntil next time,\nMarlin F."

One thing that’s apparent in anything I saw, at least in anything I could understand, was the natural physical beauty motivating some of the theory as well the complexity of the field and delicate treatment that it demands. This is the main reason why getting a proper start has been particularly challenging for me. I wanted to be confident that I can give the material justice. What I forgot is that there’s a beauty in trying and failing.

Let’s say you have 150 shot glasses to sell and want to sell them for at most 3 dollars per shot glass. If you know that you will have 50 loyal customers who will buy a shot glass regardless of price and that you will sell 5 more each time you decrease the price by 5 cents, how can you maximize your revenue? Using the fact that revenue is price times the quantity sold, we can write our revenue \\(R\\) as:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nR(n)= (3-0.05n)(50+5n)=150 + 12.5n - 0.25n^2.\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nWe can take the derivative of this and set it equal to 0 to find the optimal value of \\(n\\) which maximizes our profit.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dR}{dt}= 12.5-0.5n=0\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn this case, we see that the optimal value of \\(n\\) is 25. That is, to maximize our revenue we must sell 75 shots glasses total. Because of this, we should set a minimum price of $1.75 to prevent losing out on profit from the price decreasing further!\n\n\n\nGraph of \\(R(n)\\). Notice the peak!\n\n\nThis is the case where we’re only selling one object. What if we wanted to sell shot glasses and teddy bears? Then our revenue and pricing depends on two variables: the number of shot glasses and the number of teddy bears. Using multivariable calculus, we can solve this kind of problem! I will not do this example in full, but it’s something fun to figure out how to solve! Hint: Find the stationary values for shot glasses and teddy bears independently.\n\n\n\nVisualizing the case with shot glasses and teddy bears\n\n\nThese examples all occur in finite dimensional spaces, but as we’ll see, moving to spaces with infinitely many dimensions forces to change our methodology a bit since our current methods depend on finding solutions to a finite number of equations."

Intuitively, we know the answer to this is a straight line, but to begin attacking this question, it makes sense to restrict the kinds of paths we can take to only those that are reasonable. In particular, we restrict our attention to the following set of functions:\n\\[\\mathscr{F}=\\{f\\colon [a,b]\\to \\mathbb{R} \\mid f(0)=\\alpha, f(1)=\\beta, \\text{ and $f$ is differentiable}\\}.\\]\nIn order to find the curve which minimizes the distance between two points, it’s then our goal to find the function(s) with the minimum arc length. We can represent the arc length \\(s\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) as \\[s=\\int_{a}^{b}ds,\\] where \\(ds\\) represents an infinitesimal arc length.

    "text": "The Euler-Lagrange Equation\nOne criterion is that any stationary point or extremal function \\(f\\) satisfies the following equation when the functional \\(I[\\cdot]\\) of the form above:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} \\right)-\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}=0.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis is called the Euler-Lagrange equation. It’s useful for solving this kinds of optimization problems because it helps one identify local extrema i.e. candidates for maxima and minima, but the Euler-Lagrange equation is not sufficient to identify whether functions are maxima or minima or neither1.\nIt is however, extremely useful in the example we started above! Shifting our focus back to the arc length example. Taking partial derivatives, we see that \\[\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'}=\\frac{y'}{\\sqrt{1+y'^2}}.\n\\] We can see the second term of the Euler-Lagrange must be zero since \\(F(x,f,f')\\) does not depend on the function \\(y\\) itself in this case. Simplifying, we see that\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{y'}{\\sqrt{1+y'^2}} \\right)= 0\\]\nfor any extremal function \\(y\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{y'}{\\sqrt{1+y'^2}}\\) must be constant. Rearranging, we see that \\(y'(x)\\) itself must be some constant \\(m\\). Therefore, after integrating, we find that \\[y(x)=mx+b \\] for constants \\(m\\) and \\(b\\). Plugging in the boundary conditions from our function space \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) gives us that our extremal function \\(y\\) is:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\ny(x)=\\left(\\frac{\\beta-\\alpha}{b-a}\\right)(x-a)+\\alpha\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich is precisely the straight line between \\((a,\\alpha)\\) and \\((b, \\beta)\\). In this case, the function we derive is the same we expect. We have not proved that this \\(y\\) is the minimizing function, but that it is the only extremal value for the functional. Classifying this extremal functions is a bit more complicated and I’ll discuss this another time! Intuitively, it would make since that this function is minimizing, so we’ll just accept this for now.\nIf you need a bit of convincing, you can play with the desmos calculator below! It shows that the straight line gives the minimum arc length when compared to the the family of paths between \\((a, \\alpha)\\) and \\((b, \\beta)\\) described by\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nf_\\epsilon(x)=\\left(\\frac{\\beta-\\alpha}{b-a}\\right)(x-a)+\\alpha + \\underbrace{\\epsilon (x-a)(b-x)}_{\\eta_\\epsilon(x)}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThat is, we consider a family of deviations \\(\\eta_\\epsilon\\) from the straight line \\(y\\).\n\n\nThe interesting thing about the calculus of variations is how natural it feels. People are always concerned with the best way to achieve things and most of the time it doesn’t boil down to picking a couple of numbers to solve a single problem, but can depend on the entire form or process or set of possible ways we and nature2 rely on in our attempts to ‘optimize’ the world around us. May that be as simple as proving a straight line is the shortest path between points or as complicated as describing the best fuel distribution to find a reactor of minimal critical mass.\nThat’s all I have to say for now! This is a start to a whole new project of mine (I’m pretending it’s my undergrad thesis since you can’t write one for the math major @ UChicago). It’s a truly beautiful subject matter I’ll be diving into and I’m looking forward to writing more about it!\nThanks for taking the time to read! I’m always open to suggestions about what to write about, so please contact me if you’ve any ideas.\nUntil next time,\n– Math, Magic, & Other Poems.\nMarlin F."

In everyday life, we often hear or say phrases like “That was pretty random.” or “What are the odds of that happening?”, but can you explain what it really means for something to be ‘random’ or ‘up to chance’? Whether you’re a gambler, an anxious student, or just plain sick and tired of the weather recently, you probably want to understand something in your life that seems or feels random.\nProbability is an attempt to make sense of this perceived randomness and provide some laws or axioms for describing random processes so that we can investigate them systematically. In practice, we know that a probability describes the chance that some event will (or will not occur), but this answer alone leaves much to be desired. There’s several fundamental questions we’re left to answer.\nIn my case, the first that comes to mind is “How does one measure a probability?”"

    "text": "A coin toss is the most basic probability model.\nIn many scenarios, we flip a coin to decide the outcome. For example, if one wants to decide which person goes first in checkers or who has to take out the trash, it’s not uncommon to hear someone say “Let’s flip a coin for it.” Why is this? Is this even fair? What does ‘fair’ even mean when you leave something up to chance like this?\nWell, you might say it’s fair because your intuition tells you that around half of the time we toss a coin it should come up heads and the other half tails. More simply said, we have two possible outcomes \\(\\omega = H\\) and \\(\\omega = T\\) which we think are equally likely (whatever that means).\nTo be precise and consistent, we’ll write these possible outcomes in terms of a set\n\\[\n\\Omega = \\{ H,T \\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing \\(\\Omega\\)\n\n\nAs you can see in the most basic coin toss, there are only two outcomes in this experiment. This is a handy model if we need to make a decision between exactly two possible choice, but what will happen if we have 3, 4, or even 1000 possible outcomes.\nLet’s switch to a more complicated example: tossing two coins sequentially. In case of two tosses, we can represent outcomes by looking at the two coin tosses separately. The first toss being \\(\\Omega_1 = \\\\{ H, T \\\\}\\) and the second \\(\\Omega_2 = \\\\{ H, T \\\\}\\). Putting these together, we can see that we have four possible outcomes\n\\[\n\\Omega = \\Omega_1 \\times \\Omega_2 = \\{ HH, HT, TH, TT\\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nOutcomes \\(\\Omega\\): two coins.\n\n\nThe coin tossing example is extremely neat in that sense that it serves as a nice foundational example for the larger language around probability which we’re trying to develop. As our next step towards that goal, we’ll begin by defining a couple of terms.\nAn outcome \\(\\omega\\) is a single possible result of a given experiment like the coin tosses above.\nThe set of possible outcomes \\(\\Omega\\) is called the sample space.\nAnother important type of objects are events \\(E\\) which describe some subset of outcomes. Events enable us to ask questions about and compute probabilities concerning several different outcomes simultaneously.\nFor example, we might ask the question: “When do we have at least one heads?”. We can then look at individual outcomes \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\) which have at least one head and write them as a set\n\\[\nE = \\{ \\omega \\mid \\text{There is at least one $H$} \\} = \\{HH, HT, TH \\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nSample space \\(\\Omega\\) and an event \\(E\\).\n\n\nOftentimes, we’re interested in the case where an event \\(E\\) does not occur. We call this event the complement of \\(E\\) and write\n\\[\nE^c = \\{w \\not\\in E \\},\n\\]\nwhich is the set of outcomes in our sample space that are not in \\(E\\). In the example above where \\(E\\) is the set where there is at least one \\(H\\),\n\\[\nE^c = \\{ \\omega \\mid \\text{There are exactly zero $H$}\\}  = \\{ TT \\}.\n\\]\nIn the case of two coin tosses, it’s easy enough to count our possible outcomes, but in order to gain a better picture of our coin-tossing experiment in general, we want to understand the specific properties or chances of our outcomes and combinations of them. That is, when discussing events like above, we want to compare and contrast them in various ways. Important tools for this are called the union (\\(\\cup\\)) and intersection (\\(\\cap\\)) of events."

Suppose we flip two fair coins. Let \\(A\\) be the event where exactly two tosses show heads, \\(B\\) where the first coin is heads, and \\(C\\) where the second coin is tails. We begin by writing all of these different events using set notation, so that\n\\[\nA = \\{HH\\}, B = \\{HH, HT\\}, C = \\{HT, TT \\}.\n\\]\nFirst, we’ll find the union of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). In words, this is the event where either the first coin shows heads or the second is tails. In set notation, this is simply:\n\\[\nB\\cup C = \\{HH, HT \\} \\cup \\{HT, TT \\} = \\{HH, HT, TT \\}.\n\\]\nNext up, let’s find the union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). This is the case where either both coins show heads or the first coin shows heads. Writing this out, we see that\n\\[\nA\\cup B = \\{HH \\} \\cup \\{HH, HT\\} = \\{HH, HT\\} = B.\n\\]\nThe event \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\) (\\(A\\subset B\\)). You can think about this as follows: If both coins show heads, then the first coin obviously did. This is obvious, but it helps us make a general observation. Sometimes events will completely contain another. If every outcome in event \\(A\\) is also in event \\(B\\), we say that \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\) and write \\(A\\subset B\\).\n\n\n\nVisualizing subsets (\\(\\subset\\)).\n\n\nLet’s try our hand with the intersection. Starting with the intersection of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). This is the event where either the first coin shows heads and the second is tails. Using sets, we take the outcomes that \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) have in common\n\\[\nB\\cap C = \\{HH, HT \\} \\cap \\{HT, TT \\} = \\{HT \\}.\n\\]\nIn this case, our intersection only contains a single outcome \\(HT\\) i.e. the case where the first coin showed heads and the second showed tails which is exactly what we were looking for.\nOur choice of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) lead to us having a very simple intersection, but thee fact remains that some events are disjoint or mutually exclusive, meaning that they do not share any outcomes. Take \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) for example. It is impossible for both coins to show heads and for the second coin to show tails simultaneously. We can write this as\n\\[\nA\\cap C = \\{HH \\} \\cap \\{HT, TT \\} = \\varnothing,\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\varnothing\\) is the empty set containing no elements.\nWith the above ideas in mind, how might we want to describe the probability of various events given that we know that the probability of each coin being heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)? In the next section, we’ll develop axioms for dealing with problems in probability."

    "text": "Axioms of probability\n\\[\n\\newcommand{ \\Prob }{ \\mathbb{P} }\n\\]\nFor this section, I’ll loosely follow Foundations of the Theory of Probability by A.N. Kolmogorov.\nIn a way, we can think of a probability as a way of measuring an event. Much like how people have weights (in both pounds and kilograms), we can think about creating a type of rule or measure \\(\\Prob\\) which weights events and collections of events relative to all possible outcomes. If we’re able to find such a measure, we want it to follow a certain set of rules much like the case of the coin tossing example.\n\n\n\nProbability measures \\(\\Prob\\) take sets to probabilities.\n\n\nFirst up is a simple convention, we would like all probabilities that things happen to be \\(1\\). In the simplest case, an event \\(E\\) can either surely occur so that \\(\\Prob(E) = 1\\) or it cannot \\(\\Prob(E) = 0\\). Therefore, if we look at all possible outcomes simultaneously, we have \\(\\Prob(\\Omega) = 1\\).\nSince all probabilities are positive or zero, we also require that \\(\\Prob(E)\\geq 0\\) for all events \\(E\\).\nLastly, if two events cannot occur simultaneously i.e. \\(A \\cap B = \\varnothing\\), then \\(\\Prob(A \\cup B) = \\Prob(A) + \\Prob(B).\\)\n\n\n\nVisualizing disjoint summations\n\n\nTherefore, our notion of probability must follow these three fundamental rules:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Prob(\\Omega) &= 1,\\\\\n\\Prob(E) &\\geq 0 \\text{ for all events } E,\\\\\n\\Prob(A \\cup B) &= \\Prob(A) + \\Prob(B) \\text{ if } A \\cap B = \\varnothing.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe call these three rules our axioms of probability. They define a way of thinking about probability that is both consistent with our intuition and mathematically useful. If you’ve seen probability before, you’ll probably notice that our three axioms are missing some of the basic statements of probability you’ve previously encountered. Most of those statements are the logical consequences of the axioms we’ve outlined. In this sense, our axioms are a way of describing probability with minimal assumptions. Namely, with these axioms alone, we can show that\n\\[\n\\Prob(A) \\leq \\Prob(B) \\text{ if } A \\subset B.\n\\]\nThis also makes sense if we return to the intuition of counting outcomes. If there are more possible outcomes in \\(B\\), then you expect that the chance \\(B\\) occurs is greater than the chance that \\(A\\) occurs as there are now more outcomes to choose from.\n\n\n\nProbability inequality for subsets\n\n\nWhen it comes to taking the union of subsets, there’s a more general formula for subsets which may or may not have overlap.\n\\[\n\\Prob(A \\cup B) = \\Prob(A) + \\Prob(B) - \\Prob( A \\cap B ).\n\\]\n\n\n\nVisualizing the general summation formation for probability of events\n\n\nFormal note: Though it is tempting to say that the set of measurable sets contains every subset, this can sometimes lead us to some strange contradictions. The idea of a permissible collection of measurable sets is formalized by a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra. You can learn a bit more about this on wikipedia."

    "text": "Application: Vampire Hunting with Bayes’\nSuppose that we’re the average American and we’re deeply concerned with discovering vampires Given that vampires are a one in a million occurrence, we can use Bayes’ theorem alongside the fact that a limited number of people are allergic to garlic and that all vampires are allergic to garlic to ‘test’ for vampires. Let’s write this in terms of probabilities. According the what we’ve written above, we know three things:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Prob(V+) &= \\frac{1}{1000000} = 0.000001,\\\\\n\\Prob(G-\\mid V-) &= \\frac{1}{10000} = 0.00001,\\\\\n\\Prob(G- \\mid V+) &\\approx 1,\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(V+\\) is vampirism positive, \\(V-\\) is human, \\(G-\\) is garlic allergy, \\(G+\\) is garlic tolerant. Plugging this into Bayes’ theorem, we can calculate the probability of being a vampire if you’re allergic to garlic\n\\[\n\\Prob(V+ \\mid G-) = \\frac{\\Prob(G- \\mid V+) \\cdot \\Prob(V+)}{\\Prob(G-)}.\n\\]\nWe have all the values to compute this value except for the probability of being \\(G-\\). We can compute this by taking advantage of the conditional expectation and the Law of Total Probability. That is, we write that\n\\[\n\\Prob(G-) = \\underbrace{  \\Prob(G-\\mid V+) \\cdot \\Prob(V+) }_{\\Prob(\\text{Garlic-allergic vampires})} + \\underbrace{ \\Prob(G-\\mid V-) \\cdot \\Prob(V-) }_{\\Prob(\\text{Garlic-allergic humans})}.\n\\]\nTherefore, the probability that someone is vampire given they’re allergic to garlic\n\\[\n\\Prob(V+ \\mid G-) = \\frac{\\Prob(G- \\mid V+) \\cdot \\Prob(V+)}{ \\Prob(G-\\mid V+) \\cdot \\Prob(V+) + \\Prob(G-\\mid V-) \\cdot \\Prob(V-)}.\n\\]\nThinking of this in terms possible outcomes, this equation shows that probability of being a vampire given a known garlic allergy is the just fraction of garlic-allergic individuals who we expect to be vampires. Since garlic allergy is much more common among vampires, testing first for garlic allergies allows us to have a higher probability of correctly identifying vampires. Computing with the probabilities given above, we find that\n\\[\n\\Prob(V+ \\mid G-) \\approx 0.01 >>> \\Prob(V+) = 0.000001.\n\\]\n\n\n\nIllustrating Bayes\n\n\nTesting for a garlic-allergy means that we’ll be nearly 10,000 times more likely to successfully identify a vampire than if we just randomly tested or sampled the population for vampires. Though vampires are still rare among those with garlic allergies, we’ve managed to increase the probably of them being identified through the garlic test. There is still hope though. By this same logic, the better our ability to test for vampires and their unique characteristics, the easier it becomes to identify them using Bayes’ Theorem. That means that we can use other methods for identifying vampires such as mirrors and our garlic test together to further increase this probability by considering the probabilities jointly. That being said, please don’t go frolicking your neighborhood waving around garlic and hand mirrors, it’s improbable you’ll find anything.\nThis post is the first part of a series where I’ll be going over some of the basic ideas behind the basic probability and stats used in my daily research. Next up, I’ll be writing about probability distributions and estimating parameters for them. For a more thorough introduction to probability, I recommend “Theory of Probability and Random Processes” by Koralov and Sinai.\nThank you for taking the time to read! - Marlin Figgins."

This allows healthcare workers to give proper time, attention, and care to those in need as they’re able to replenish their supplies and prevent people from going untreated as new cases come in. This way our local healthcare systems do not become overwhelmed as cases quickly peak. A drawn out, less severe outbreak is preferable in order for people to get access to the care they need if they’re infected. In fact, as we continue to increase the availability of treatment and slow the infection we will likely be able to drive down the mortality rate associated with COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Health care demand: Unchecked v.s.

University testing programs may provide timely epidemiologic and genomic surveillance data to inform public health responses. We conducted testing from September 2021 to February 2022 in a university population under vaccination and indoor mask mandates. A total of 3,048 of 24,393 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR; whole genome sequencing identified 209 Delta and 1,730 Omicron genomes of the 1,939 total sequenced. Compared to Delta, Omicron had a shorter median serial interval between genetically identical, symptomatic infections within households (2 versus 6 days, P = 0.021). Omicron also demonstrated a greater peak reproductive number (2.4 versus 1.8), and a 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 0.58, 1.57; P < 0.0001) higher mean cycle threshold value. Despite near universal vaccination and stringent mitigation measures, Omicron rapidly displaced the Delta variant to become the predominant viral strain and led to a surge in cases in a university population."

    "text": "The World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern in July 2022. To investigate global mpox transmission and quantify the effect of population-level interventions on controlling spread, we built phylogeographic and phylodynamic models to analyze MPXV genomes from five global regions together with air traffic and epidemiological data. Our models reveal community transmission prior to detection, changes in case-reporting throughout the epidemic, and a large degree of transmission heterogeneity. We find that viral introductions played a limited role in prolonging spread after initial dissemination, suggesting that travel bans would have had only a minor impact. We find that mpox transmission in North America began declining before more than 10% of high-risk individuals in the USA had vaccine-induced immunity. Given that cases quickly declined after detection most likely due to behavioral modifications, our findings highlight the importance of broader routine specimen screening surveillance for emerging infectious diseases."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Genomic surveillance of pathogen evolution is essential for public health response, treatment strategies, and vaccine development. In the context of SARS-COV-2, multiple models have been developed including Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) describing variant frequency growth as well as Fixed Growth Advantage (FGA), Growth Advantage Random Walk (GARW) and Piantham parameterizations describing variant Rt. These models provide estimates of variant fitness and can be used to forecast changes in variant frequency. We introduce a framework for evaluating real-time forecasts of variant frequencies, and apply this framework to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during 2022 in which multiple new viral variants emerged and rapidly spread through the population. We compare models across representative countries with different intensities of genomic surveillance. Retrospective assessment of model accuracy highlights that most models of variant frequency perform well and are able to produce reasonable forecasts. We find that the simple MLR model provides ~0.6% median absolute error and ~6% mean absolute error when forecasting 30 days out for countries with robust genomic surveillance. We investigate impacts of sequence quantity and quality across countries on forecast accuracy and conduct systematic downsampling to identify that 1000 sequences per week is fully sufficient for accurate short-term forecasts. We conclude that fitness models represent a useful prognostic tool for short-term evolutionary forecasting."

    "text": "Knockout of the ORF8 protein has repeatedly spread through the global viral population during SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Here we use both regional and global pathogen sequencing to explore the selection pressures underlying its loss. In Washington State, we identified transmission clusters with ORF8 knockout throughout SARS-CoV-2 evolution, not just on novel, high fitness viral backbones. Indeed, ORF8 is truncated more frequently and knockouts circulate for longer than for any other gene. Using a global phylogeny, we find evidence of positive selection to explain this phenomenon: nonsense mutations resulting in shortened protein products occur more frequently and are associated with faster clade growth rates than synonymous mutations in ORF8. Loss of ORF8 is also associated with reduced clinical severity, highlighting the diverse clinical impacts of SARS-CoV-2 evolution."

Recent studies have used the sample proportions of different variants from sequence data to describe variant frequency dynamics and relative transmission rates, but frequencies alone cannot capture the rich epidemiological behavior of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we extend methods for inferring the effective reproduction number of an epidemic using confirmed case data to jointly estimate variant-specific effective reproduction numbers and frequencies of co-circulating variants using case data and genetic sequences across states in the US from January to October 2021. Our method can be used to infer structured relationships between effective reproduction numbers across time series allowing us to estimate fixed variant-specific growth advantages. We use this model to estimate the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest in the United States and estimate consistent growth advantages of particular variants across different locations."

For viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza understanding how viruses differ in their fitness can help us to better forecast their evolution. This allows us better understand the process of evolution itself, but also has practical applications in improving vaccines.\nCurrently, I am interested in tying in mechanistic models of transmission, immunity, and recovery to improve methods for evolutionary forecasting. The hope is that by including more information about these processes, we can gain better estimates of relative fitness and better forecasts for virus populations."
